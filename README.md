# Design Pattern Examples
This repo is a playground to test different design patterns. The patterns may be used in a contrived sense but that's okay. All we care about here is getting some code written to help reinforce the patterns.

All implementations are done with modern C++. The project can be opened, built, and run with Visual Studio.
